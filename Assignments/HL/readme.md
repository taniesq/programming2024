# HL programming assignment

Write classes (including the main method to test that your class works as intended) to simulate/implement:

- [ ] a STACK using an array (*isEmpty, isFull, push, pop,* and *printStack* methods).
- [ ] a QUEUE using an array (*isEmpty, isFull, enQueue, deQueue,* and *printQueue* methods).
- [ ] a LIST using an array (*isEmpty, isFull, append, remove* (by index), *insert* (at index), and *printStack* methods).

Use the ListArray and StackArray classes, and pages 10~37 of the Advanced Computer Science for the IB Diploma textbook (green cover).

### Extra challenge:
- [ ] Copy our LinkedList class and code an extra add method to add a node or integer in a way to keep the linked list sorted in ascending order.
